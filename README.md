## About Me
- Learnt .NET since 2019 (with Visual Basic), and then moved to C# since 2022.
- I usually make projects with Blazor Server and Hybrid w/ WPF, but Desktop App is most preferable.
- Sprinkled with a bit of XAML, HTML and CSS knowledge.
- Other frameworks / techs I could work with are ASP.NET Core Web API, Entity Framework, SQL Server, SQLite.
- Likes to be _alone_, often _alone_, and enjoys working _alone_.
- Just say good words to me or keep silent, because **`this.Feel`** is little bit fragile.

Sometimes I do App's demonstration on my [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@rlvy).
